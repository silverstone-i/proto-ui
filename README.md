# proto-ui

proto-ui is a web-based UI prototype designed for managing project costs, financial transactions, and reporting across multiple companies. Its primary objective is to demonstrate the functionality of navigation bars and data display through a mock interface, employing mock data for dynamic loading without actual backend logic or authentication mechanisms.

## Overview

The application leverages the Vite build framework and React for UI rendering, styled with Material UI components. It simulates dynamic data loading using mock JSON files, providing a hands-on experience with the UI prototype. The project is structured with essential configuration files, React components for building the UI, and mock data stored in JSON format within the `public` directory.

## Features

- **Login Page:** A simulation of user authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Provides access to various sections such as Ledger, Projects, and Contracts.
- **Ledger Page:** Includes submenus for Accounts, Journal Entries, and Vendors, each displaying data dynamically loaded from mock JSON files.
